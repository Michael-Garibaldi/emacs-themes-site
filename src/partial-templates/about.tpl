    <p>This tries to be a comprehensive resource for those interested in Emacs themes. It is a collection of popular and underground, old and new <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html">Emacs Themes.</a>
    </p>

    <p>If you want to add you own theme go to <a href="https://github.com/emacs-themes/emacs-themes-site">GitHub</a>. But if you find it hard to do it just <a href="mailto:vlad.piersec@gmail.com">email me</a>.
    </p>


    <h3 class="tipe">Tip!</h3>
    <p>You should always use the <strong>Official Source</strong>, or the version from  package if available, instead of Local Source (This is the source code of the theme at the time of the post creation. In the meantime there could have been a lot of changes/updates to the code. So don’t risk it. I only keep the code here because it may disappear (no pun intended) and this website tries to be a long-time resource).
    </p>

    <p>I don’t have the time and energy to list all the themes but if you want your theme to be listed or have any suggestions/thoughts regarding the site, <a href="mailto:vlad.piersec@gmail.com">email me</a> !</p>
